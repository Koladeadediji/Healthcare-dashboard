Introduction
This project focuses on visualizing various healthcare variables and show how they are realted to one another. The dataset contains valuable information about key parameters about healthcare details and treatment conducted by various doctors and in various hospitals.
Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from kaggle data catalogue, accesible at the following link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadehsan000/healthcare-dataset-2019-2024

Data Processing
Importing Data
I started by importing the dataset from the source. The data contains columns for several columns like Age, Gender, Blood group, Medical Condition, Insurance Provider, Hospital, Doctor, Billing Amount and Date of admission

Data Cleaning and Transformation
I performed Data cleaning and transformation to ensure the consistency of the dataset. This includes removing empty columns to make sure I am not processing a zero data, ensuring there's no outlier, also ensuring there's no duplicate data and the data was ready for processing.

Analysis and Insights
I conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset to extract meaningful insights that could aid decision -making. This shows in the dashboard I was able to project in `Healthcare dataset project.pbix `
